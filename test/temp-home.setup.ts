// Every test file runs against a temp home and a temp app registry, pinned here so no test file has
// to remember. env.ts resolves CONFIG_DIR from HUB_CONFIG_DIR at import time and tuiLog appends a log
// file under it, so a file that reaches a logger, a config read or a plugin scan without pinning
// first reads and writes the developer's real app home. Setup files run before a test file is
// loaded, so a file needing its own home still overrides this. A module reaching the app registry
// without the HUB_APPS_FILE pin below reads the developer's real ~/.config/cairn/apps.json.
